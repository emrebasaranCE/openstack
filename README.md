## Emre's OpenStack Github Repo

Hi, in this repository I will try to create multiple exercises on open source cloud software called OpenStack.

- #### [Installing OpenStack](install_and_create_instance/README.md#3-changing-direction-to-the-devstack) 

- #### [Downloading and Uploading Image to OpenStack](install_and_create_instance/README.md#41-lets-upload-ubuntu-image-to-our-cloud) 

- #### [Creating Instance on OpenStack](install_and_create_instance/README.md#42-creating-a-new-instance)
