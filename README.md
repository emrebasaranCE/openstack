## Emre's OpenStack Github Repo

Hi, in this repository I will try to create multiple exercises on open source cloud software called OpenStack.

- #### [Installing OpenStack](install_openstack/install_openstack.md) 

- #### [Downloading and Uploading Image to OpenStack](install_image_and_upload/install_image_and_upload.md) 

- #### [Creating Instance on OpenStack](create_instance/create_instance.md) 

- ### [Installing Orchestration Service(Heat)](install_heat/install_heat.md)

- ### [Connect Jenkins to the Openstack](connect_jenkins/connect_jenkins.md)
